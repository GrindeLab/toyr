# toyr

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `toyr` is to demonstrate how to create an R package. The
functions in this package are not particularly useful. See the package
vignettes for documentation on how to create a package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of toyr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("GrindeLab/toyr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

To make sure you can view vignettes (the useful part of this package),
donâ€™t forget the `build_vignettes = TRUE` argument.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the one and only
function in this package:

``` r
library(toyr)
toy_function()
#> [1] "This is a function"
```

See the `creating-a-package` vignette for the useful part of this
package\!
