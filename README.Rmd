# toyr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `toyr` is to demonstrate how to create an R package. The functions in this package are not particularly useful. See the package vignettes for documentation on how to create a package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of toyr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("GrindeLab/toyr")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the one and only function in this package:

```{r example}
library(toyr)
toy_function()
```


See the `creating-a-package` vignette for the useful part of this package!
